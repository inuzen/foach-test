The task was to create an app which has a form validation
which lets you get to the App page with react-router.

The button must be disabled until all fields meet the requirements. 

On the app we render a list of cards(initialized in Redux) and
have an option to switch the "On Vacation" box.

All styles must be done with Material UI with emphasis on fonts and Switch styles
